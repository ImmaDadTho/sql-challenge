# Employee Analysis

In this assignment I analyze a corporations CSV files containing employee and salary information from the 1980s and 1990s. 
I will perform `Data Modeling`, `Data Engineering`, and `Data Anlaysis`. First I create my database `Employee_Database`

##Data Engineering

I start the assignment by using ERD to sketch out the tables I will be creeating and also to show the relationship between
tables.

##Data Analysis

Here I take the information provided and create schema tables, after creating one schema table im import the csv file related 
to the specific table and also specify the primary key, foreign keys and/or composite key. I also query the table to make sure
all the data has been imported succesfully.

##Data Analysis

Finally once I completed the tables for my database I started my Analysis specifically eight queries and I also renamed columns
to better display information for the queries, the queries are as follows,

- 1. listed the Employees by Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary. 

- 2. listed first name, last name, and hired date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

- 3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name,        first name.
